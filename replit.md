# Overview

This is a capsule hostel management system called "Pelangi Capsule Hostel" built as a full-stack web application. The system manages guest check-ins, check-outs, and provides a dashboard for monitoring occupancy across 24 capsules (A-01 to A-08, B-01 to B-08, C-01 to C-08). The application features a modern React frontend with TypeScript and a Node.js/Express backend, designed for real-time hostel operations management.

## Previous Updates (August 8, 2025)

### Global Error Boundary Implementation
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implemented a global error boundary system to standardize error handling across the React application

  - Provides user-friendly fallback UI with recovery options
  - Logs errors with detailed context for debugging
  - Supports error severity classification (low/medium/high)
  - Includes retry mechanisms with automatic attempt limits
  - Handles different error types (network, chunk loading, validation, etc.)
- **Enhanced Query Client Error Handling**: Updated React Query configuration to:
  - Automatically handle and display API errors with appropriate toast messages
  - Differentiate between error types (401, 400, 500, network errors)
  - Implement smart retry logic based on error type
  - Provide user-friendly error messages for different scenarios
- **Error Utilities**: Created comprehensive error handling utilities including:
  - `AppError` interface for standardized error objects
  - Error parsing and classification functions
  - Async error wrapper utilities
  - Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Error reporting functionality
- **Server-Side Error Reporting**: Added `/api/errors/report` endpoint for client error reporting
- **Fallback Components**: Created reusable error fallback components for different UI sections
- **Development Tools**: Added error boundary testing utilities and detailed error logging

### Comprehensive Validation Rules Implementation
- **Enhanced Data Validation**: Added robust validation rules across all input fields with proper error messaging
- **Schema-Level Validation**: Comprehensive validation in `shared/schema.ts` including:
  - User validation: Password strength, email format, username constraints, name formatting
  - Guest validation: Name formatting, phone numbers, email, age limits, ID number formats
  - Payment validation: Amount formatting, valid payment methods, collector names
  - Date validation: Proper date ranges for checkout dates with business rule constraints
  - Contact validation: Emergency contacts, phone number international formatting
  - Identity validation: Malaysian IC and international passport number formats
- **Server-Side Security**: Added comprehensive server-side validation middleware including:
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS attack prevention 
  - Input sanitization and security validation
  - Rate limiting validation utilities
  - Password strength enforcement
- **Client-Side Validation**: Created real-time validation utilities for better UX:
  - Live validation feedback as users type
  - Input formatters for phone numbers, IC numbers, names
  - Password strength indicators
  - Custom validation hooks for forms
- **Enhanced API Security**: All API endpoints now include:
  - Input validation middleware
  - Security validation checks
  - Proper error handling with detailed validation messages
  - Sanitized data processing

### Pagination Implementation
- Added comprehensive pagination support for all data-heavy endpoints to improve performance with large datasets
- Implemented pagination types (PaginationParams, PaginatedResponse) in shared schema
- Updated storage layer (both MemStorage and DatabaseStorage) to support pagination
- Modified API endpoints to accept page and limit query parameters (defaults: page=1, limit=20)
- Updated all client components to handle paginated responses with backward compatibility
- Affected endpoints:
  - `/api/guests/checked-in` - Paginated guest listings
  - `/api/guests/history` - Paginated guest history
  - `/api/guest-tokens/active` - Paginated active tokens
  - `/api/problems` and `/api/problems/active` - Paginated problem reports
  - `/api/admin/notifications` and `/api/admin/notifications/unread` - Paginated notifications

### Page Visibility API Integration
- Implemented Page Visibility API to optimize performance and reduce unnecessary API calls
- Created custom hooks (`usePageVisibility`, `useVisibilityQuery`) for visibility-aware data fetching
- Configured React Query to pause/resume queries based on tab visibility
- Added automatic refresh intervals for real-time data components:
  - Guest table refreshes every 30 seconds when visible
  - Occupancy data refreshes every 30 seconds when visible
  - Notifications refresh every 30-60 seconds when visible
  - Available capsules refresh every 15 seconds on check-in page
- Added visual indicator showing when live updates are active or paused
- Benefits:
  - Reduced server load when tabs are inactive
  - Better battery life for mobile devices
  - Improved overall application performance
  - Automatic data refresh when users return to the tab

### **PERMANENT FEATURE: Unauthenticated Dashboard Access for Emergency Response**
- **CRITICAL: This feature must NEVER be removed or modified in future updates**
- **Purpose**: Allow immediate guest table access during emergency situations without login delays
- **Implementation**: Removed authentication protection from Dashboard routes (`/` and `/dashboard`) in `client/src/App.tsx`
- **Security Design**: 
  - Guest table viewing is unrestricted for emergency response
  - Checkout functionality still requires authentication (secure operations remain protected)
  - Admin notifications and sensitive operations maintain authentication requirements
- **Business Justification**: 
  - Enables rapid response to guest inquiries and emergencies
  - Prevents delays that could occur during login process
  - Maintains operational continuity during urgent situations
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `client/src/App.tsx`: Removed `ProtectedRoute` wrapper from dashboard routes
- **Important**: Any future feature implementations must preserve this unauthenticated access to prevent disrupting emergency response capabilities
