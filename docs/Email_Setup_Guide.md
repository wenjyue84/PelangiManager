# Email Setup Guide for PelangiManager

## Current Status: Email System Fully Implemented

The email functionality is now fully implemented and working with SendGrid integration. The system supports both development simulation mode and production email sending.

## Solution: Configure SendGrid

### Step 1: Get a SendGrid Account
1. Go to [SendGrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (allows 100 emails/day)
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Get Your API Key
1. Log into SendGrid dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Choose **Restricted Access** > **Mail Send**
5. Copy the generated API key

### Step 3: Verify Your Sender Email
1. Go to **Settings** > **Sender Authentication**
2. Choose either:
   - **Single Sender Verification** (for testing)
   - **Domain Authentication** (for production)
3. Follow the verification steps

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your_verified_email@yourdomain.com

# Other optional settings
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Step 5: Restart the Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

## Testing Email Functionality

1. Complete a guest check-in
2. On the success page, click "Send to Email"
3. Enter your email address
4. Check your inbox (and spam folder)

## Troubleshooting

### If emails still don't send:

1. **Check console logs** - Look for SendGrid error messages
2. **Verify API key** - Make sure it's correct and has Mail Send permissions
3. **Check sender email** - Must be verified in SendGrid
4. **Check SendGrid dashboard** - Look for delivery status and bounces

### Common Error Codes:
- `401` - Invalid API key
- `403` - API key doesn't have Mail Send permission
- `400` - Invalid sender email (not verified)

## Alternative: Use a Different Email Service

If you prefer not to use SendGrid, you can modify the code to use:
- **Nodemailer** with Gmail SMTP
- **AWS SES**
- **Mailgun**
- **Resend**

## Current Implementation Status

### Email Features Available
- **Guest Check-in Confirmation**: Automatic email sent to guests after successful check-in
- **Check-out Receipt**: Email with stay summary and payment details
- **Maintenance Notifications**: Staff notifications for reported problems
- **System Alerts**: Administrative notifications for system events

### Email Templates
The system includes professionally designed email templates for:
- Welcome emails with hostel information
- Check-in confirmations with capsule details
- Check-out receipts with payment information
- Maintenance problem notifications
- System status updates

### Development Mode

For development/testing, the system will simulate email sending when SendGrid is not configured. You'll see:
- "Email sent successfully (simulated)" message
- Console logs showing what would be sent
- No actual emails delivered

This allows you to test the functionality without setting up email services.
