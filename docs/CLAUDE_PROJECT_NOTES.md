## Key Files & Their Purpose
- `client/src/pages/guest-checkin.tsx` - Main guest self-check-in form (1344 lines - NEEDS REFACTORING)
- `client/src/components/guest-checkin/` - Related components (SuccessScreen, LoadingScreen, GuestInfoStep)
- `server/routes.ts` - API routes
- `server/storage.ts` - ‚ö†Ô∏è Re-export wrapper ONLY (46 lines, refactored 2025-08)
- `server/Storage/` - üèóÔ∏è Modular storage system (5 focused files, refactored 2025-08)

## Current Issues Identified
1. **guest-checkin.tsx is too large** (1344 lines) - monolithic component
2. Multiple state management scattered throughout
3. Complex form logic mixed with UI rendering

## Work History & Progress

### 2025-08-14: Initial Assessment
- Analyzed guest-checkin.tsx structure
- Identified it's a monolithic 1344-line React component
- User requested conservative refactoring approach, one step at a time

#### Guest Check-in Component Analysis:
**Current Structure:**
- State Management (Lines 33-58): 15+ useState hooks
- Effects & Side Effects (Lines 114-294): Multiple useEffect hooks
- Event Handlers (Lines 296-732): Form submission, document upload, PDF/email functions
- Render Logic (Lines 755-1344): Complex form sections

**Identified Components for Extraction:**
1. **Emergency Contact Section** (Lines 1056-1099) - EASY extraction candidate
2. **Help/FAQ Section** (Lines 1239-1284) - Self-contained
3. **Additional Notes Section** (Lines 1101-1152) - Moderate complexity
4. **Payment Information Section** (Lines 1153-1237) - Conditional rendering
5. **Document Upload Section** (Lines 858-1054) - COMPLEX, needs careful handling

**Refactoring Strategy (Conservative):**
- Phase 1: Extract simple form sections (Emergency Contact, FAQ, Notes)
- Phase 2: Extract complex sections (Payment, Document Upload)
- Phase 3: Extract custom hooks (useDocumentUpload, useFormDraft, etc.)
- Phase 4: Utility functions (Print/PDF, Email helpers)

## Conventions & Patterns Observed
- Uses react-hook-form with zod validation
- TypeScript throughout
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Tanstack Query for API calls

## Development Guidelines for This Project
1. **Test after each refactoring step** - User wants to test between changes
2. **Conservative approach** - No major architectural changes
3. **Maintain existing functionality** - Don't break anything
4. **One component extraction at a time**

## Next Actions Planned
- Start with Emergency Contact component extraction (simplest, lowest risk)
- Create reusable form section components
- Gradually reduce main component size

## Important Notes
- User prefers step-by-step approach with testing between changes
- Must maintain all existing functionality during refactoring
- Focus on readability and maintainability, not performance optimization
- Keep this notes file updated with progress and lessons learned

## Recent Work Completed

- ‚úÖ Focus on logical separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Maintain existing functionality during refactoring

### Refactoring Best Practices Established
1. **Conservative Approach**: One component at a time, test between changes
2. **Backup Strategy**: Always create backup before starting refactoring
3. **Logical Extraction**: Extract complete logical sections, not arbitrary code blocks
4. **Form Integration**: Maintain react-hook-form integration seamlessly
5. **Type Safety**: Ensure all extracted components are properly typed
6. **Testing**: Verify HMR works and functionality is preserved after each extraction

### Files Still Available for Future Refactoring
**Medium Priority Candidates** (when needed):
- `sortable-guest-table.tsx` (774 lines) - Complex table functionality
- `check-out.tsx` (488 lines) - Could be optimized further if approaches 800 lines
