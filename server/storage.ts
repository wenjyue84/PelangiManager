/**
 * Storage.ts - Modular Storage System Re-export Wrapper
 * 
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD IMPLEMENTATIONS TO THIS FILE! ‚ö†Ô∏è
 * 
 * This file serves ONLY as a backward compatibility wrapper that re-exports
 * the modular storage system from the ./Storage/ directory.
 * 
 * REFACTORING COMPLETED:
 * ‚úÖ PHASE 1: Extract interfaces and implementations to Storage/ folder
 * ‚úÖ PHASE 2: Import from modular Storage instead of inline implementations 
 * ‚úÖ PHASE 3: Reduce this file to a simple re-export wrapper
 * 
 * FILE SIZE REDUCTION: 1,557 lines ‚Üí 13 lines (96% reduction)
 * 
 * üö´ DO NOT ADD:
 * - New storage classes or implementations
 * - Business logic or data manipulation
 * - Database operations or queries
 * - Interface definitions
 * - Helper functions or utilities
 * 
 * ‚úÖ ONLY ALLOWED:
 * - Re-export statements from ./Storage/
 * - Backward compatibility exports
 * - Type-only exports for TypeScript
 * 
 * üìÅ FOR NEW STORAGE FEATURES, EDIT THESE FILES INSTEAD:
 * - ./Storage/IStorage.ts        - Interface definitions
 * - ./Storage/MemStorage.ts      - In-memory implementation
 * - ./Storage/DatabaseStorage.ts - Database implementation  
 * - ./Storage/StorageFactory.ts  - Factory and initialization
 * - ./Storage/index.ts           - Module exports
 * 
 * üîÑ MIGRATION GUIDE:
 * - All existing imports from './storage' continue to work unchanged
 * - TypeScript types are preserved and fully compatible
 * - Runtime behavior is identical to the original monolithic file

// Re-export storage implementations for backward compatibility

export { storage } from "./Storage/index";

// Re-export the IStorage interface type for TypeScript type checking
export type { IStorage } from "./Storage/IStorage";
